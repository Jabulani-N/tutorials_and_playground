# Vid2Aud

This project is a Python application that extracts the audio from video files and creates an audio file. It does this on every video within the folder you select, and matches the organization of folders you have videos in. TL;DNR: **it makes an "audio version" of your video stash**.


The current release can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/Jabulani-N/tutorials_and_playground/releases/tag/v1.0.0.0).



# Use Instructions

1. Upon opening the app, you'll be asked about your input videos:

    * (top option) your videos are in a folder named `input` next to the app itself
    * (middle option) you'd like to select a folder containing the videos you want to get audio from
    * (bottom option) you'd like to cancel and close the application

    * ![screen one](../../../img/vid_manip/where%20are%20your%20input%20vids_%203_21_2025%208_34_35%20PM.png)

2. After your first selection, you'll be asked where you'd like to put the extracted audio files:
   * (top option) make a new `output` folder right next to the app, and put them in there.
   * (middle option) pick a folder to put them in
   * (bottom option) you'd like to cancel and close the application
   * ![screeen two](../../../img/vid_manip/where%20would%20you%20like%20to%20place%20the%20audio%20files_%203_21_2025%208_34_56%20PM.png)

3. Now that you've selected your videos and where you want to put them, we'll make sure you're ready to go
   * (top option) everything looks good and we'll begin extracting audio
   * (middle option) start over: go back to the start, without doing anything with the current selections
   * (bottom option) you'd like to cancel and close the application
   * ![screen three](../../../img/vid_manip/Begin_%203_21_2025%208_35_35%20PM.png)
