# Video Manipulation

This directory contains a Pyhton project created for the purpose of batch converting video files to audio files (**not** by destroying the vid files).

I created this because I wanted to convert about a hundred video files I had on hand to m4a audio format, <details>
<summary>but...</summary>

</details>

My goal with this project is to craete an easy-to-use python application to extract audio from video files.

Currently, this whole directory will need to be downloaded to run the script, and it'll require external installations. Now that a gui has been implemented, the next steps include putting the whole project into an all-inclusive package.
