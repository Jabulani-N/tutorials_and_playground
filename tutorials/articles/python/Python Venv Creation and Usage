# Python Virtual Environments

## Why?

Your venv is your laboratory.

These delightful spaces protect your main machine from getting clogged up with pyhton installs you only need fo r asingle project, and let you use whatever versoin of a library you want without having to change your main workspace to suit the project.



## How?

### Creation

`python -m venv venvName`

### Activation

#### Windows

`.\venvName\Scripts\activate`

#### Linux

`source venvName/bin/activate`

Example
* ```

root@LAPTOP-NLNOP13P:/mnt/d/Git_Repositories/Audio-Unifier# source work_venv_lin/bin/activate
(work_venv_lin) root@LAPTOP-NLNOP13P:/mnt/d/Git_Repositories/Audio-Unifier# 
```

### Deactivate

You'll know it worked because you'll have `(venvName)` preceding your command line

You can deactivate your virtual environment with `deactivate`, which will return you to normalcy.

### working in the context of your venv

when your venv is created, you'll need to work in the "context" of it to use the virtual python installment and its modules.

Start your line with `python -m` to work in the venv's context.
